 <p> Hi!! I am a second year software engineering major.I am interested in web development 
    because it is fun and you can do a lot of cool things with it. I like trying new recipies,
    going new places and meeting new people. I have always envisioned myself pursuing a career 
    in technology, with no other path ever crossing my mind.  Finally, I hope to make a difference 
    in the world some day.
